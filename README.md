# AGs_News_Classification_

AG's news Topic Classification dataset is constructed by choosing 4 largest classes from the original corpus composed of 1 milion articles. Each class contains 30000 training samples and 1900 testing samples summing to a total number of training sample of 120000 and testing sample of 7600. The main purposes of our analysis are:

Through the Topic Modelling methods, we constructed class clusters to compare them to the true categories that we have.
Use one Neural Network model to classify the data.
Use a Transformer based\Language Model model to classify the data.
