📜 Text Analysis and Classification

This project encompasses a comprehensive analysis of text data, primarily focusing on three key aspects:

1️⃣ 📊 **Clustering Insights**: Discover the underlying structure of our dataset by applying sophisticated Topic Modeling techniques, including LDA and NMF. These clusters are meticulously compared to the true categories for valuable insights.

2️⃣ 🔍 **Neural Network Classification**: Experience the power of Neural Networks in classifying articles across diverse categories. After rigorous experimentation with various RNN models, we've selected the top-performing models—GRU and LSTM—for their superior predictive accuracy.

3️⃣ 🤖 **Transformative Models**: Step into the realm of cutting-edge Transformer-based Language Models. Explore how BERT enhances classification accuracy and offers improved insights.
